# Your Music
## Description 
This is a simple music player app which lets you browse and play sound tracks saved on your android device, it provides features like playing music in background, controlling music through notification etc.
This project along with [**GuardianNews**](https://github.com/farbodbj/GuardianNews) were the two projects I have completed as an exercise in the process of my android bootcamp.

## Design Process
The new [**Jetpack media3**](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media3) was the core library used in this project. [**MediaStore**](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore) was used for providing an real-time access (using Flow api & kotlin coroutines) method to the music files from device storage, [**MediaSessionService**](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/media3/session/MediaSessionService) for managing audio playback along with media3 in-built exoplayer and media session. It was tried to keep the design scalable and robust while avoiding unnecessary complications.
